Upstreamr is a dynamic configuration loader for NGINX that supports Environment Manager based configuration. It polls configuration in Dynamo or DNS sources looking for changes and efficiently reflects these into the running NGINX instance.

Upstreamr is a separate project with its own Github repository. Please refer to this for [setup instructions](https://github.com/trainline/upstreamr)
